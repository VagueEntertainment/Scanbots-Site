## Welcome to the Scanbots Project Site!

### Contributing to Scanbots

Scanbots is split into three parts for the project, intended to be built for the GitHub 2017 GameOff!

The three parts are as follows:

#### Scanbots Base
The Scanbots Base is a desktop application, or webapp, that allows you to manage, build, train, and battle your Scanbots.

#### Scanbots Scanner
The Scanbots Scanner is a mobile app that lets you scan barcodes in order to obtain Scanbot parts in order to build and upgrade your Scanbots!

#### Scanbots Server
The software that Base and Scanner connects to in order to track your Scanbots and sync the Scanbot parts you've scanned so that they show up in your base.
